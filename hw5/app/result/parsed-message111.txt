What: "To organize helper methods in your libraries; you can keep static methods specific to an interface in the same interface rather than in a separate class." Here helper methods means a static method that is frequently used in many code (for example, the static method in Utils.java in HW2.) If some static methods are directly related to an interface, defining it in the interface could be better to define them in a seperate class. This is just a tip from original java creators. Hope this make more clearer about the question.
